### Pathfinder Visualizer

Tool for visualizing path finding algorithms.
Currently there are:

- Dijkstra weighted search that guarantees the shortest path
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) not weighted search that guarantees the shortest path
- Depth-First Search (DFS) not weighted search that does not guarantees the shortest path
- A\* weighted search that guarantees the shortest path, the heuristic function based on manhattan distance calculations

## Setup

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

`yarn build`

Builds the app for the production to the `dist` folder.
